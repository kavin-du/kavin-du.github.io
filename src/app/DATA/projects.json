    "description": "Our solution is to replace the human waiter with a robot waiter and also to replace the traditional menu cards system with a more attractive and efficient order placing system. On an event where a customer visits the restaurant he/she can place the order via the order placing system and once the ordered items are ready, the items will be delivered to the customer. Our solution will help the customer to select the food items more efficiently with help of the reviews from previous customers and also if an item is unavailable that item will not be shown in the menu. The WaiterBot system will help the restaurant by providing an efficient delivery mechanism. WaiterBots will not mess up orders and they will deliver the food items to the correct table. Also this may be a new experience for the customers and the WaiterBot system will attract more customers to the restaurant.",
